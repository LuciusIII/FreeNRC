# FreeNRC
Small &amp; simple python script which looks past the paywall on NRC, a Dutch newspaper

Written in python 3
FreeNRC abuses the fact that NRC includes hidden articles in the source code of their web pages, even if the pay wall hasn't been unlocked.
I'm not sure this is legal! Use at your own risk.
